# PRODIGY_WD_03
I have developed a Tic-Tac-Toe web application as Task 03 of my web development internship.It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a 3x3 grid where two players can take turns clicking cells to place their markers (X or O). A restart button allows users to reset the game and play again.
